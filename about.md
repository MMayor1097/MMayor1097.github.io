Hi, My name is Michael Mayor. I'm from Naperville, Illinois and currently a Master's student at the University of Notre Dame studying Business Analytics. Last May, I graduated from Purdue University's Krannert School of Management with a degree in Supply Chain Analytics and Marketing. In my time at Notre Dame, I have had the opportunity to particpate in a variety of projects using R, Python, SQL, and Tableau. Outside of school, I am involved with Notre Dame's Baseball Analytics club where I create scouting reports and visualizations for the Notre Dame coaching staff. If you find any of these projects interesting, feel free to contact me!
